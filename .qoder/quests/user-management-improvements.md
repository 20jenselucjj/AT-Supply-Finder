# User Management Improvements Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed improvements to the user management page in the admin panel. The enhancements include adding an "Add/Invite User" functionality, improving action buttons (particularly the "View User Details" feature), and removing the "New" text from the user management quick link button.

## Current State Analysis

The current implementation uses the `EnhancedUserManagement` component which provides:
- User listing with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Bulk operations (role changes, deletion, export)
- Basic user creation/invitation functionality
- User statistics cards
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

However, there are several areas for improvement:
1. The "View User Details" functionality is not fully implemented
2. The "New" badge on the User Management sidebar link should be removed
3. Action buttons could be more intuitive and user-friendly
4. User detail viewing experience could be enhanced

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Remove "New" Badge from Sidebar Link

**Location**: `src/components/layout/AdminLayout.tsx`

**Change**: Remove the `badge: 'New'` property from the User Management sidebar item.

```typescript
{
  id: 'users',
  label: 'User Management',
  icon: Users,
  href: '/admin/users',
  requiredRole: 'admin'
}
```

### 2. Enhanced User Detail View

**New Component**: `UserDetailView`
- Create a modal dialog to display comprehensive user information
- Include user metadata, activity history, and role assignments
- Provide quick access to user actions (edit role, deactivate, delete)
- Display user statistics and engagement metrics
- Show audit trail of user activities
- Include user's created content (kits, favorites, etc.)

**Implementation**:
- Add a new dialog component that appears when clicking the "View" action button
- Fetch detailed user information including audit logs and activity history
- Display user information in a structured, readable format

### 3. Improved Action Buttons

**Current Issues**:
- Action buttons only appear on hover, reducing discoverability
- Limited actions available for each user
- No dedicated "View Details" button

**Improvements**:
- Make action buttons always visible (not just on hover)
- Add a dedicated "View Details" button with appropriate icon
- Improve button grouping and spacing for better usability
- Add tooltips for better understanding of each action
- Implement a dropdown menu for additional actions
- Use consistent iconography and styling
- Ensure accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes

### 4. Enhanced User Creation/Invitation Flow

**Improvements**:
- Add validation for email format
- Provide better feedback during the invitation process
- Add option to send custom invitation message
- Show success/error messages with clear next steps
- Add ability to invite multiple users at once
- Implement invitation status tracking

**UI Design**:
- Create a multi-step dialog for user creation/invitation
- Add form validation with real-time feedback
- Provide clear instructions for each step
- Show progress indicator for multi-step process
- Include preview of invitation email before sending

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

To support enhanced user management features, we need to add a new SQL migration file:

```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250815181500_enhanced_user_management.sql

-- Add indexes for better performance on frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_profiles_email ON user_profiles(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_profiles_role ON user_profiles(role);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_profiles_last_sign_in ON user_profiles(last_sign_in_at);

-- Create a function to get detailed user information
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_details(user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
    id UUID,
    email TEXT,
    role TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    last_sign_in_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    email_confirmed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN,
    audit_logs JSONB
)
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
    SELECT 
        u.id,
        u.email,
        COALESCE(ur.role, 'user') as role,
        u.created_at,
        u.last_sign_in_at,
        u.email_confirmed_at,
        (u.last_sign_in_at IS NOT NULL AND u.last_sign_in_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days') as is_active,
        (SELECT jsonb_agg(al.* ORDER BY al.timestamp DESC) 
         FROM audit_logs al 
         WHERE al.user_id = u.id 
         LIMIT 10) as audit_logs
    FROM auth.users u
    LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
    WHERE u.id = user_uuid;
$$;

-- Create a function to get user activity statistics
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_activity_stats(user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
    total_kits INTEGER,
    total_favorites INTEGER,
    last_activity TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
)
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
    SELECT 
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_kits WHERE user_id = user_uuid) as total_kits,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_favorites WHERE user_id = user_uuid) as total_favorites,
        GREATEST(
            (SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM user_kits WHERE user_id = user_uuid),
            (SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM user_favorites WHERE user_id = user_uuid)
        ) as last_activity;
$$;

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_details TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_activity_stats TO authenticated;
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Detail Dialog] --> B[User Information Section]
    A --> C[Activity History Section]
    A --> D[User Content Section]
    A --> E[Action Buttons]
    
    B --> B1[Email Address]
    B --> B2[User ID]
    B --> B3[Role]
    B --> B4[Account Status]
    B --> B5[Registration Date]
    B --> B6[Last Login]
    
    C --> C1[Recent Audit Logs]
    C --> C2[Activity Timeline]
    C --> C3[Statistics]
    
    D --> D1[Created Kits]
    D --> D2[Favorited Products]
    
    E --> E1[Edit Role]

    E --> E3[Delete]
    E --> E4[Close]
```

### Action Button Improvements

**Current action buttons (hover-only)**:
```
[Eye] [Edit] [More...]
```

```
[View] [Edit] [Actions â–¼]
```

With the dropdown containing:
- Change Role
- Deactivate User
- Delete User
- View Audit Logs
- Send Message

### Responsive Design

The user management interface will be optimized for different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full table view with all columns visible
- Tablet: Collapsible columns with priority ranking
- Mobile: Card-based layout with expandable sections

## Security Considerations

1. All user management operations must be restricted to admin users only
2. Audit logging must be implemented for all user management actions
3. Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
4. Rate limiting for user creation/invitation to prevent abuse
5. Input validation to prevent injection attacks
6. Proper authentication checks for all user management endpoints
7. Secure handling of user data and PII
8. Implementation of proper access controls for user details
9. Protection against enumeration attacks when viewing user information
10. Secure storage and transmission of user data

## Performance Considerations

1. Implement pagination for user lists to prevent performance issues with large datasets
2. Use virtualization for large tables to improve rendering performance
3. Implement proper indexing in the database for frequently queried columns
4. Cache frequently accessed user data to reduce database load
5. Optimize audit log queries to prevent performance degradation
6. Implement lazy loading for user detail views
7. Use debouncing for search and filter operations
8. Optimize image loading for user avatars
