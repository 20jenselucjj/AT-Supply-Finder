# Refactoring Strategy and Guidelines

This document outlines the strategy and guidelines for refactoring large components into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve code maintainability and readability.

## 1. Identifying Components for Refactoring

### File Size Thresholds
- Components larger than 500 lines should be considered for refactoring
- Components larger than 1000 lines should be prioritized for immediate refactoring
- Files with multiple responsibilities should be split regardless of size

### Code Smells Indicating Need for Refactoring
- Multiple state management sections
- Different UI sections that could be separated
- Repeated code patterns
- Complex conditional rendering
- Multiple data fetching operations
- Large useEffect hooks with multiple responsibilities

## 2. Refactoring Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Component
1. Identify distinct sections of functionality
2. Map out component state and how it's used
3. Identify props being passed down
4. Note any context usage
5. Document data flow

### Step 2: Plan the Split
1. Create a directory structure for the refactored component
2. Identify which parts can become standalone components
3. Determine shared state and how it will be managed
4. Plan the component hierarchy
5. Define interfaces and types needed

### Step 3: Execute the Refactoring
1. Create the new directory structure
2. Define TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Extract components one by one, starting with leaf components
4. Move state management to appropriate levels
5. Update imports and references
6. Test each step to ensure functionality is preserved

### Step 4: Verify and Optimize
1. Ensure all functionality is preserved
2. Check for performance regressions
3. Verify TypeScript types are correct
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Remove any unused code

## 3. Component Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each component should have one clear purpose:
- UI components should only handle rendering
- Container components should manage state and data fetching
- Presentational components should receive data through props

### Component Hierarchy
1. **Container Components**: Handle state, data fetching, and business logic
2. **Layout Components**: Handle page structure and component arrangement
3. **UI Components**: Handle user interaction and presentation
4. **Utility Components**: Handle specific utility functions

### State Management
- Lift state up to the nearest common ancestor
- Use context for global state that crosses component boundaries
- Keep local state in components that directly use it
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or composition

## 4. Directory Structure Guidelines

### Component Directory Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── feature-name/
│   │   ├── index.ts          # Export all components
│   │   ├── types.ts          # TypeScript interfaces and types
│   │   ├── ComponentName.tsx # Main container component
│   │   ├── SubComponent1.tsx # Child components
│   │   ├── SubComponent2.tsx
│   │   └── ...
```

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component files and components
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Group related components in directories
- Use index.ts for exporting components

## 5. TypeScript Best Practices

### Interface Design
- Create specific interfaces for each component's props
- Use shared interfaces for related components
- Define optional properties with `?`
- Use union types for variant props

### Type Safety
- Always define prop types for components
- Use generics where appropriate
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode
- Avoid using `any` type

## 6. Testing Considerations

### Unit Testing
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock dependencies and props
- Test different prop combinations
- Verify state changes and side effects

### Integration Testing
- Test component composition
- Verify data flow between components
- Test user interactions across components

## 7. Performance Considerations

### Memoization
- Use `React.memo` for components with expensive render operations
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props

### Bundle Size
- Code-split large components when possible
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Remove unused dependencies

## 8. Migration Strategy

### Incremental Refactoring
1. Create new refactored components alongside existing ones
2. Use feature flags or conditional rendering to switch between versions
3. Gradually migrate usage to new components
4. Remove old components once fully migrated

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain the same public API when possible
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Deprecate old components gracefully

## 9. Code Review Checklist

Before merging refactored components, ensure:
- [ ] Component is under 300 lines (preferably under 200)
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Component has a single responsibility
- [ ] No prop drilling issues
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Adequate test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] No console logs or debugging code

## 10. Tools and Techniques

### Recommended Tools
- ESLint with React plugins for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- React DevTools for component debugging
- Bundle analyzer for size optimization

### Refactoring Techniques
- Extract Component: Pull out sections into new components
- Lift State Up: Move state to parent components
- Component Composition: Use children and render props
- Higher-Order Components: For cross-cutting concerns (use sparingly)
- Custom Hooks: Extract reusable logic
