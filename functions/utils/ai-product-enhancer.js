You are an expert product data analyst specializing in medical and first aid supplies. 
Your task is to enhance the product data by:
1. Creating a concise, descriptive product name (max 50 characters) - make it appealing to medical professionals, never use "..." or other truncation symbols
2. Improving the feature descriptions to be more informative and professional while preserving ALL factual information, technical specifications, sizing details (like "1-inch by 10 yard-roll"), and measurements from the original listing - focus on benefits for medical use
3. Classifying the product into the most appropriate category from these options: Wound Care & Dressings, Tapes & Wraps, Antiseptics & Ointments, Pain & Symptom Relief, Instruments & Tools, Trauma & Emergency, Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), First Aid Information & Essentials, Hot & Cold Therapy, Hydration & Nutrition, Miscellaneous & General

IMPORTANT CATEGORY GUIDELINES:
- "Antiseptics & Ointments" includes antibiotic ointments, antiseptic wipes, burn gels, and other topical treatments for wounds and skin conditions. This is the correct category for products like "Triple Antibiotic Ointment". Products applied directly to the skin for treatment go here. Examples: Neosporin, Bacitracin, Polysporin, antibiotic ointments, burn gels, antiseptic solutions.
- "Pain & Symptom Relief" includes oral pain relievers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen), antihistamines, antacids, and other medications taken internally. This category is for pills, tablets, and liquids consumed by mouth. Products that are swallowed go here. Examples: Advil, Tylenol, Benadryl, Pepto-Bismol.
- "Wound Care & Dressings" includes bandages, gauze, dressings, and wound cleaning supplies. This category is for products that cover or clean wounds. Examples: Band-Aids, gauze pads, wound wash solutions.
- "Tapes & Wraps" includes medical tapes, elastic bandages, and athletic tape. This category is for products used to secure dressings or provide support. Examples: athletic tape, medical adhesive tape, elastic bandages.
- "Instruments & Tools" includes scissors, tweezers, thermometers, and other medical tools. This category is for physical tools used in first aid. Examples: trauma shears, tweezers, digital thermometers.
- "Trauma & Emergency" includes emergency blankets, splints, and tourniquets. This category is for critical emergency response items. Examples: emergency blankets, SAM splints, tourniquets.
- "Personal Protection Equipment (PPE)" includes gloves, masks, and hand sanitizer. This category is for infection control and protection items. Examples: nitrile gloves, face masks, hand sanitizer.
- "First Aid Information & Essentials" includes first aid guides and emergency contact information. This category is for informational and documentation products. Examples: first aid manuals, emergency contact cards.
- "Hot & Cold Therapy" includes heat packs, cold packs, and topical analgesic creams. This category is for temperature-based therapeutic products. Examples: ice packs, heat wraps, topical analgesic creams.
- "Hydration & Nutrition" includes electrolyte packets and energy gels. This category is for products that support hydration and nutrition. Examples: Gatorade powder, energy gels.
- "Miscellaneous & General" includes items that don't fit other categories. Only use this for products that clearly don't belong in any other category.

4. Extracting quantity information when available (e.g., "100 ct", "12 pack", "50 sheets") - look in title, features, dimensions
5. Identifying the main material when relevant (e.g., "sterile gauze", "nitrile", "latex-free", "adhesive", "foam", "plastic") - look in title, features, description

Product Data:
- Title: ${productData.title}
- Brand: ${productData.brand || 'Not specified'}
- Features: ${Array.isArray(productData.features) ? productData.features.join(', ') : 'Not specified'}
- Category: ${productData.category || 'Not specified'}
- Dimensions: ${productData.dimensions || 'Not specified'}
- Weight: ${productData.weight || 'Not specified'}

Please respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "name": "Enhanced product name (max 50 characters, no truncation symbols like ..., complete words only)",
  "features": ["Professional feature description 1. Preserves all original facts, technical details, and sizing information like 1-inch by 10 yard-roll.", "Professional feature description 2. Maintains all specifications, measurements, and product dimensions.", "Professional feature description 3. Highlights medical benefits, applications, and includes all sizing details."],
  "category": "Most appropriate category",
  "quantity": "Quantity information if available (e.g., '100 ct', '12 pack')",
  "material": "Main material if identifiable (e.g., 'adhesive', 'foam', 'latex-free', 'sterile gauze')"
}

Guidelines:
- Keep product names concise but descriptive (max 50 characters)
- Never use "..." or other truncation symbols in product names
- Complete words only, no partial words
- For features, focus on medical benefits and use cases while preserving ALL original facts and technical details:
  * Highlight sterility, safety, and medical compliance
  * Emphasize ease of use for medical professionals
  * Mention specific applications in medical settings
  * Focus on quality, durability, and performance
  * Preserve ALL technical specifications, measurements, materials, sizing information (e.g., "1-inch by 10 yard-roll"), and factual information from the original listing
  * Never omit, summarize away, or lose important details including specific measurements and sizing
  * Present facts in a more professional and readable format without losing any information
  * Convert technical jargon into clear, professional language while keeping all specifications
  * Ensure all sizing, dimensions, and measurement details are explicitly included in the features
  * Features can be longer if needed to include every aspect of the product
- Use standard first aid/medical supply categories
- Extract quantity from title, features, or dimensions when possible
- Identify materials by looking for terms like: adhesive, foam, latex-free, sterile gauze, plastic, fabric, metal, cotton, polyester, silicone, rubber, vinyl, etc.
- Look for material terms in the product title and features
- If no clear material is identifiable, leave this field empty
- Only include fields that can be meaningfully enhanced
- If quantity is found, prefer it over weight in the response
- Make sure features are clear, benefit-focused, and concise
- Product names should be suitable for catalog listings but still informative
